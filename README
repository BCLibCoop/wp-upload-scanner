Upload Scanner Plugin for WordPress
--------------------------------------

This plugin will scan any uploaded files (detected via $_FILES) with ClamAV.  It
can also be configured to work with an admin-configured system command so third
party scanners can be used.

When a positive result is found, the remediation actions can be configured to
e-mail the site admin, quarantine the file, or send a 406 status and stop
Wordpress execution.

Since the $_FILES superglobal is used, and no WordPress hooks, this should work
for other plugins that accept file uploads, too, including front-end plugins,
and flash-based uploader.


How to use
--------------------------------------
Copy the upload-scan folder to your site's wp-content/plugins folder, then
activate the plugin, and visit your "Upload Scan" settings page to configure it.


It says ClamAV isn't installed?
--------------------------------------
You'll need to install ClamAV and php-clamav.

http://php-clamav.sourceforge.net

You don't actually need ClamAV to use this plugin, though.  You can use the
system command to run another scanner that can accept input on the command line.

For example, you could scan with avira like this:

    avscan $UPLOAD_SCANNER_ORIG_TEMPNAME
